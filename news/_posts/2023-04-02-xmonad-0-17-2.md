A new version of `xmonad` has been released. Check out our [download
page]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link download.md %}) for instructions on
where to get it.

This minor version release is purely for compatibility with GHC 9.6;
more precisely, it allows `xmonad` to build with `mtl` version 2.3.1, as
well as `unix` version 2.8.0.0.
