title: An Update for our Sponsors—and a Request

It has been a little bit over a year since XMonad [version 0.17.0] was
released; this was also the time in which we first started looking for
funding.  On the whole, the number of people who decided to support us
has been astounding: thank you!  While our expenses are [completely
transparent][oc:xmonad], it can be hard to keep up if you're not
directly involved in the project.  Hence, we'd like to take this
opportunity to summarise what we did in the past year.

- We met up!  More specifically, many of us went to
  [ZuriHac 2022][ZuriHac2022]; conferences like these are a great
  opportunity to get to know the team a little bit better, as well as to
  discuss plans and future directions.  Not to mention we had the
  opportunity to talk to (a surprising number of) users!  In addition, a
  few also attended [MuniHac 2022][MuniHac2022]; again, some great
  conversations were had with people as excited about XMonad as us.

  If you missed these, then don't worry: plans are already being made
  for [ZuriHac 2023][ZuriHac2023], and we hope to see you there—we'll
  bring stickers!

- Since 2021-10-27[^1], the `xmonad-contrib` repository has seen quite
  some activity: all in all, almost 400 commits have been made!
  Needless to say, this means a lot of new features, as well as
  several—sometimes long-standing—bugfixes.  This could probably not
  have been done without your financial support, allowing some of us to
  spend some more time with XMonad than before.  As far as future plans
  go, we plan on completely overhauling the XMonad prompt, making it
  behave more sensibly in common situations.

  The core of XMonad, the `xmonad` repository, has long since been
  declared "stable"; yet, we still managed to squeeze in just under
  40 commits.  Additionally, in the recent past we have been working on
  a [redesign][xmonad#432] of the way XMonad handles refreshes, which
  might enable us to squash other long standing issues with the way the
  logHook interacts with the `windows` function.

  While some of this work is unreleased as of yet, during all of this
  time we also managed to release version XMonad version 0.17.1.

Recently, GitHub decided to [stop support PayPal][gh:blog:no-paypal],
which caused a lot of free software projects to lose sponsors—we were no
exception to this.  So that we can continue spending as much time on
XMonad as we have, please think about [renewing your
contribution][ghub:xmonad:sponsor] with updated payment details!  If you
want to know what exactly happens with the money: all of our monetary
activity is completely transparent, and can be viewed [here][oc:xmonad].
Thanks!
